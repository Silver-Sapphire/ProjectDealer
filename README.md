CS50 Final Project

    My final project for CS50, a limited multiplayer recreation of Cardfight!! Vanguard, using love2D; 
as well as a seperate custom echo type server (in another project folder) to distribute game events to both players.

Current implimentation lacks option customization, deck building, supplimentary mechanics (ride deck, g zone, gift markers, ect.),
but is desighned to be easily scaleable to add such features once the project is submitted, as I continue to grow and expand upon it,
until it hopefully becomes the new free community hub for online play.

To run the game, click and drag its project folder (project dealer) onto a shortcut for love2d.
